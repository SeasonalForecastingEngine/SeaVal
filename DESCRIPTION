Description: Provides tools for processing and evaluating seasonal weather forecasts, 
    with an emphasis on tercile forecasts. We follow the World Meteorological Organization's 
    "Guidance on Verification of Operational Seasonal Climate Forecasts", 
    S.J.Mason (2018, ISBN: 978-92-63-11220-0, URL: <https://library.wmo.int/idurl/4/56227>). 
    The development was supported by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation 
    programme under grant agreement no. 869730 (CONFER).
