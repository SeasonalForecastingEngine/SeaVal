```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE:
* Non-standard file/directory found at top level: 'scripts'

This folder contains example scripts that can be run to highlight features of the package.
I would like to keep the current directory structure because it makes it easier to share these scripts with 
the researchers we developed this package for, via GitHub.

* This is my first CRAN submission.

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run check on downstream dependencies of SeaVal.
