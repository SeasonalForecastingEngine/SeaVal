## In this talk:

* How do we evaluate forecasts in general?
* Evaluating Seasonal forecasts using the `R`-package `Seaval`
* Example: evaluation of the October 2021 precipitation prediction issued at the September GHACOF


## 

* Evaluating past predictions helps us understand forecast deficits and strengths
* Did the seasonal forecast exhibit skill (was it better than the climatology forecast)?
* In what regions was skill high, where was it low?
* We need to use performance measures that 
  + reward better forecast
  + allow comparison to climatology


## Evaluation-pipeline:

* load your prediction (in a suitable format)
* get observations, including observations of past years!
* scale observations and predictions onto the same grid
* create climatology forecast for reference
* Compare prediction and climatology forecast using objective performance metrics

## Evaluating tercile forecasts

<!-- *  -->
<!-- * The threshold values low, normal and high depend on the local climatology -->
<!-- * Emphasis lies on the category that gets predicted the highest probability, so we could think about evaluating like this: -->
<!-- \[BS_{\max} = (p_{\max}-e_{\max})^2,\] -->
<!-- where $p_{\max}$ is the probability assigned to the maximum probability category (between 0.33 and 1), and $e_{\max} = 1$ if the observation falls into that category and $0$ else.  -->
<!-- * low values of $BS_{\max}$ seem to indicate a good forecast -->

<!-- ## -->
<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap=""} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("/nr/project/stat/CONFER/Presentations/CCH/2021-04-12 - time to stuff eval/CounterexampleBSonHighProbCat.PNG") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * Scores need to be *proper*, meaning that they systematically reward good forecasts. The $BS_\max$ is not proper. -->

<!-- ## -->
* Seasonal precipitation predictions are often issued in terms of three probabilities: one for low, one for normal, and one for high precipitation.

* The following score is called the *multicategory Brier skill score*:
\[MBSS := \frac{3}{2}(2/3 - (p_1 - e_1)^2 + (p_2 - e_2)^2 + (p_3 - e_3)^2).\]
Here, $p_1,p_2,$ and $p_3$ are the predicted probabilities for the three categories, and $e_i$ is 1 if the observation falls in the $i$th category, and 0 else.
  + $MBSS = 0$: your forecast is as good as climatology
  + $MBSS > 0$: it is better
  + $MBSS = 1$: your forecast is perfect.

## The `SeaVal` package

* `R` package for validation of seasonal forecasts 
* Currently developed at the Norwegian Computing Center with input from ICPAC
* Provides tools for evaluating forecasts, including data import/export and plotting
* getting started:
 + Install the open-source statistical programming software `R`
 + type the following:
 ```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('SeasonalForecastingEngine/SeaVal')
```
should work on every laptop/server, wherever you are...

## Example: evaluating the October 2021 precipitation forecast

get the forecast as netcdf (not shown), and import as `R` data table:

```{r,echo = TRUE}
setwd('/nr/project/stat/CONFER/Data/validation/example_data/202109/') 
prediction = netcdf_to_dt('PredictedProbabilityRain_Oct_Sep2021.nc',
                          verbose = 0)
print(prediction[!is.na(below)][1:5,])
```


## get observations:

```{r,eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
download_chirps(temp_res = 'monthly', 
                save_dir = '/nr/project/stat/CONFER/Data/CHIRPS/')
obs = process_chirps(temp_res = 'monthly',
              chirps_dir = '/nr/project/stat/CONFER/Data/CHIRPS/')
# subset October
obs = obs[month == 10]
print(obs)
```
```{r,echo = FALSE,eval = TRUE}
obs = fread('/nr/project/stat/CONFER/Data/pres2021_11_15/obs.csv')
obs[,month := 10]
print(obs)
```

## derive climatology:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
obs = add_tercile_cat(obs)
print(obs)
```

## join observation and prediction:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
eval_dt = merge(prediction, obs[year == 2021],
                by = c('lon','lat'))
eval_dt[,year := NULL][,month := NULL]
print(eval_dt)
```

## plot observations:

```{r,echo = FALSE,fig.height = 4,fig.width = 8}
obs[,anomaly:= prec - mean(prec),by = .(lon,lat)]

pp1 = ggplot_dt(eval_dt,'tercile_cat',low = 'red',high = 'blue') + ggtitle('Observed tercile category')
pp2 = ggplot_dt(obs[year == 2021],'anomaly',low = 'red',high = 'blue',midpoint = 0) + ggtitle('Observed rainfall anomaly')

ggpubr::ggarrange(pp1,pp2,ncol = 2)

```


## plot predictions:
```{r,echo = FALSE}

eval_dt[,below:=below/100]
eval_dt[,above:=above/100]
eval_dt[,normal:=normal/100]

pp1 = ggplot_dt(eval_dt,
                'below',high = 'red',low = 'blue',
                midpoint = 1/3,discrete_cs = TRUE,binwidth = 0.1, 
                guide = guide_colorbar(barwidth = 8,barheight = 0.5, direction = 'horizontal',title.position = 'top')) + ggtitle('predicted probability below') +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
pp2 = ggplot_dt(eval_dt,
                'normal',high = 'forestgreen',low = 'darkgoldenrod1',
                midpoint = 1/3,discrete_cs = TRUE,binwidth = 0.1,
                guide = guide_colorbar(barwidth = 8,barheight = 0.5, direction = 'horizontal',title.position = 'top')) + ggtitle('predicted probability normal') + 
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
pp3 = ggplot_dt(eval_dt,
                'above',high = 'blue',low = 'red',
                midpoint = 1/3,discrete_cs = TRUE,binwidth = 0.1,
                guide = guide_colorbar(barwidth = 8,barheight = 0.5, direction = 'horizontal',title.position = 'top')) + ggtitle('predicted probability above') + 
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')

ggpubr::ggarrange(pp1,pp2,pp3,ncol = 3)

```

## evaluate prediction

<div style= "float:right;position: relative; ">
```{r,fig.width = 4.5}
mbss = MBSS_dt(eval_dt,obs_col = 'tercile_cat')
pp = ggplot_dt(mbss,'MBSS',
               high = 'darkgreen',low = 'purple',
               discrete_cs = TRUE,binwidth = 0.2,
               midpoint = 0, 
               mn = 'MBSS for October prediction')
plot(pp)
```
</div>


- prediction performed better than climatology in the eastern part of the Kenya, southern Somalia and southern Ethipoia
- everywhere else the prediction performed equally good as climatology



## summary

The `SeaVal` package provides functionality for:

- importing predictions as netcdf
- downloading observations (CHIRPS)
- matching data on different grids
- evaluating forecasts
- plotting results
- exporting netcdfs
- more to come...
