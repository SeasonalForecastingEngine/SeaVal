# Introduction {-}
    
The `R`-package `SeaVal` provides functionality and many useful tools for evaluating seasonal forecasts. It is developed by the [Norwegian Computing Center](https://nr.no/en/) as part of the Horizon 2020 project [CONFER](https://confer-h2020.eu/). The goal of this project is to improve seasonal weather predictions in east Africa. Some functionality of this package is tailored to this purpose, specifically to evaluation practice and datasets at [ICPAC](https://www.icpac.net/), while other will be useful for evaluating seasonal predictions in general.

Evaluating seasonal weather predictions requires an entire pipeline of tasks, including

* Importing the predictions 
* Downloading and importing corresponding observations
* Matching predictions and observations, e.g. when they are on different grids
* Evaluating forecast skill
* Visualizing and exporting results

The `SeaVal` package provides tools for all of these tasks. The development of this package is supported by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no. 869730 (CONFER).


# Getting Started

This tutorial shows how to get started with `SeaVal` and introduces its main functionality by examples. 
The package can be downloaded directly from github, see description below.
`SeaVal` relies on `R` data tables (available with the `R` package `data.table`).
Data tables are more flexible and memory efficient data frames, and simplify many operations that are frequently required when working with weather- and climate data. An introduction to data tables can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).

## Installation




In order to directly install the package from github, you need the package `devtools`. So if you have not installed it yet, you should first run

```r
install.packages('devtools')
```

Thereafter, the `SeaVal` package including all dependencies can be installed by running the command 
```
devtools::install_github('SeasonalForecastingEngine/SeaVal')
```

This may take a while, especially when some of the larger dependency packages are not installed, such as `data.table` or `ggplot2`.
You may see a message like this:
```
These packages have more recent versions available.
It is recommended to update all of them.
Which would you like to update?

1: All                                 
2: CRAN packages only                  
3: None                             
...
```

In that case type '1' for all. *(It is important to not only update CRAN packages: for technical reasons, the `SeaVal` package depends on a second package `ForecastTools` hosted on github, which is also developed by the Norwegian Computing Center)*

If this completes without an error, the setup is complete and you're good to go.
Now, all you have to do is load `SeaVal`:


```r
library(SeaVal)
```

```
## Loading required package: data.table
```

```
## Loading required package: ForecastTools
```

<!-- Especially in the early development phase, it is important to occasionally update the `SeaVal` package. To this end simply run the following commands every now and then: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- devtools::install_github('SeasonalForecastingEngine/ForecastTools') -->
<!-- devtools::install_github('SeasonalForecastingEngine/SeaVal') -->
<!-- ``` -->

The rest of the tutorial is organized as follows. We will first give a few examples how to use `R`s data table syntax to perform typical tasks required for evaluation. Thereafter, we will show how `SeaVal` can be used to visualize data as spatial maps. This will be followed by examples how to import forecasts and download observations data. Thereafter, the tutorial shows how observations and predictions can be combined into a suitable dataset for evaluation. Finally, it shows how to evaluate different types of forecasts

## examples of `data.table` syntax

Here, we show some examples of basic operations on data tables. 
A short but comprehensive introduction to `data.table`s syntax can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).
The `SeaVal` package comes with a few example data sets we will use here, for example monthly mean precipitation over the GHA region for the OND season provided by CHIRPS:


```r
data("chirps_monthly")
print(chirps_monthly)
```

```
##          lon   lat      prec month year terc_cat

## 418080: 51.5  23.0 0.1387682    12 2020       -1
```

A short description of the dataset is also provided:


```r
?chirps_monthly
```

We'll now go over a few basic commands for handling this sort of data. `chirps_monthly` is a data table, which is an enhanced data frame. The most fundamental operations include subsetting, performing calculations on columns and aggregation or grouping for calculations. Examples for subsetting are

```r
chirps_monthly[month == 10] # extract the data for October
```

```

We can subset either by logical expressions (first two examples) or by row indices (third example). Subsetting always returns a data table, e.g. `chirps_monthly[1]` returns a one-row data table containing the first row of `chirps_monthly`. 

Next, let's look at examples for operations on columns:

```r
chirps_monthly[,mean(prec)] # get the mean precipitation (over all locations, months, years)
```

```
## [1] 1.995215
```

```r
chirps_monthly[,mean_prec := mean(prec)] # create a new column in the data table containing the mean
chirps_monthly[,prec := 30*prec] # transform precipitation from unit mm/day to mm (per month)
print(chirps_monthly)
```

```
##          lon   lat       prec month year terc_cat mean_prec
##      1: 22.0 -12.0  57.904762    10 1981       -1  1.995215
##      2: 22.0 -11.5  64.054807    10 1981       -1  1.995215
##      3: 22.0 -11.0  83.078648    10 1981       -1  1.995215
##      4: 22.0 -10.5 117.604856    10 1981        0  1.995215
##      5: 22.0 -10.0 146.161968    10 1981        1  1.995215
##     ---                                                    
## 418076: 51.5  21.0   7.213044    12 2020       -1  1.995215
## 418077: 51.5  21.5   6.552173    12 2020       -1  1.995215
## 418078: 51.5  22.0   6.160868    12 2020       -1  1.995215
## 418079: 51.5  22.5   4.847827    12 2020       -1  1.995215
## 418080: 51.5  23.0   4.163046    12 2020       -1  1.995215
```
Note in all cases the ',' after '[' which tells data table that you're doing an operation rather than trying to subset. We can also put things together and subset and operate simultaneously. In this case the subsetting is specified first, followed by a comma followed by the operation:

```r
chirps_monthly[month == 10 , mean(prec)] # get the mean precipitation for October (over all locations, years)
```

```
## [1] 66.30285
```
(Note that the mean is much larger now because we changed units...).
Finally, and most importantly, we can perform operations over aggregated groups: 

```r
dt_new = chirps_monthly[, mean(prec),by = .(lon,lat,month)] 
print(dt_new)
```

```
##         lon   lat month         V1
##     1: 22.0 -12.0    10  84.507765
##     2: 22.0 -11.5    10  92.716755
##     3: 22.0 -11.0    10 104.027108
##     4: 22.0 -10.5    10 116.425850
##     5: 22.0 -10.0    10 128.969907
##    ---                            
## 10448: 51.5  21.0    12   7.679457
## 10449: 51.5  21.5    12   7.247609
## 10450: 51.5  22.0    12   6.454131
## 10451: 51.5  22.5    12   5.612391
## 10452: 51.5  23.0    12   5.103941
```
Here, the 'by' command (after the second comma) tells data table to perform the operation (`mean`) for each unique instance of `lon`, `lat`, and `month` separately. As a result, the mean is taken only over all years, and a separate mean is derived for each location and each month. Therefore, this operation derives the monthly local climatology. As we can see, the output is a data table containing all columns in `by` and a column named `V1` containing the output of the operation. That's a bit impractical, so let's rename the last column:


```r
setnames(dt_new,'V1','clim') # take the data table from above and rename column 'V1' into 'clim'
```
It's also possible to name the column direcly while `dt_new` is created, like this:

```r
dt_new = chirps_monthly[,.(clim = mean(prec)),by = .(lon,lat,month)] 
# same as above, but with simultaneously setting the name of the new column
```
This can again be combined with subsetting:

```r
dt_new = chirps_monthly[year %in% 1990:2020, .(clim = mean(prec)), by = .(lon,lat,month)] 
# computes climatology based on the years 1990-2020 only.
```
In the examples above we create a new data table containing the climatology. If we instead want to add the climatology as a new column to `chirps_monthly` directly, we need to use the `:=` operator:

```r
chirps_monthly[,clim := mean(prec), by = .(lon,lat,month)] # add the climatology column directly into chirps_monthly.
```
This showcases some of the functionalities and syntax of the `data.table` package. There's a lot more to it and we recommend having a look at 
[this introduction to `data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html) if you are not familiar with data tables. In particular, this introduction explains the logic behind the syntax making it much easier to memorize.
We'll finish this section by an example where we compute the MSE for raw ecmwf forecasts:


```r
data("chirps_monthly") # reload data to reverse the changes made in the examples above.
data("ecmwf_monthly") # get example hindcasts from ecmwf

print(ecmwf_monthly) 
```

```
