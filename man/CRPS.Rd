\usage{
CRPS(
  dt,
  f,
  o = "obs",
  by = by_cols_ens_fc_score(),
  pool = "year",
  mem = "member",
  dim.check = T,
  ens_size_correction = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{Data table containing predictions and observations.}

\item{f}{column name of the forecasts. May not be called 'f'}

\item{o}{column name of the observations.}

\item{by}{column names of grouping variables, all of which need to be columns in dt.
Default is to group by all instances of month, season, lon, lat, system and lead_time that are columns in dt.}

\item{pool}{column name(s) for the variable(s) over which is averaged. Typically just 'year'.}

\item{mem}{Name of the column identifying the ensemble member.}

\item{dim.check}{Logical. If True, a simple test whether the dimensions match up is conducted:
The data table should only have one row for each level of c(by,pool,mem)}

\item{ens_size_correction}{logical. If TRUE, the CRPS is corrected for sample size (see Ferro et al. 2008: 'On the effect of ensemble size on the discrete and continuous
ranked probability scores'). This is slower, but you should do it if you compare ensembles of different size.}
